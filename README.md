# Recursive-DNS-Server-With-Golang
 
Basic recursive DNS server codded with Golang for small scale networks. Has cappable of logging to MongoDB, Selectable recursiveness and with some configurable parameters.


I use this DNS server on my local network to dont have to remember ip names no more. Being recursive is a big plus. All my DNS queries passing through this DNS server so i don't have to set ordered lookup table for every device.

To-Do:
 Truncated messages.
 Maybe some other record type can be implement.
 Some stability check could be great.
